A set of scripts and helpers to automate downloading, mapping, and decompiling Minecraft server jars using official Mojang mappings and open-source tools.

## Features

- Downloads the latest versions of decompilation tools (CFR, SpecialSource, ASM, Guava, etc.)
- Fetches Minecraft server jars and official mappings for any version
- Applies mappings and decompiles to readable Java source code
- Fully automated and cross-platform (requires Bash, curl, jq, and Java)

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, and `java` installed.

2. **Download tools:**  
   ```bash
   ./download.sh all
   ```

3. **Decompile a Minecraft server jar:**  
   ```bash
   ./decompile.sh <mc_version> [output_dir]
   # Example:
   ./decompile.sh 1.21.5 ../minecraft-src-1.21.5
   ```

   Decompiled sources will be placed in the `sources` directory inside your output directory.
